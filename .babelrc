/*
*Defining presets
*@babel/preset-env - allows us to transform ES6+ into more traditional javascript code.
*@babel/preset-react - does the same as above but with JSX instead.
*@babel/transform-runtime - (when we use async and await - babel will always assume there is a generator runtime defined and when it does not find it, will output an error - so To fix that we are using this plugin. earlier version we were importing 'babel-polyfill'
